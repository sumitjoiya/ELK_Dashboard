# ELK Dashboard FOR COVID-19 (Indonesia)

## 1. About the Dataset

The dataset contains comprehensive COVID-19 information for Indonesia, tracking the pandemic across different provinces and regions. Key data points include:

- **Daily statistics**: new cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases  
- **Geographical information**: provinces, islands, and ISO location codes  
- **Administrative details**: total regencies, cities, districts, and villages  
- **Demographic data**: population, population density, geographical coordinates  
- **Key metrics**: case fatality rates, recovery rates, cases per million  

The data granularity allows for both national and provincial-level analysis, making it valuable for understanding the pandemic's impact across Indonesia's diverse regions.

## 3. Dashboard Analysis

### Layout Analysis (ELK1 to ELK4)

#### **ELK1**  
- **Left panel**: Newly recovered patients by province, highlighting regional recovery patterns  
- **Right panel**: Relationship between active cases, recovery cases, and death cases over time  
- Current positioning effectively shows both current status and historical trends  

#### **ELK2**  
- **Left panel**: Death statistics by ISO code  
- **Right panel**: Comparison of recovery rates vs. fatality rates across islands  
- Positioning allows for direct comparison of mortality-related metrics  

#### **ELK3**  
- **Left panel**: Average deaths by location  
- **Center panel**: Fatality rates versus population by ISO code  
- **Right panel**: Key metrics (3.9% fatality rate, 8m population)  
- Current arrangement effectively presents mortality analysis from different angles  

#### **ELK4**  
- **Top row**: Key metrics:  
  - Total cases: **29,927**  
  - Deaths: **5,147**  
  - Recovered: **19,406**  
  - New active cases: **1,962**  
  - Locations: **34**  
- **Bottom row**:  
  - Distribution of cases by ISO code  
  - New cases by location  
- Layout provides a clear summary dashboard with the most important metrics

### Key Insights

1. **Geographic Distribution**:  
   - Java region (particularly Java Barat) shows the highest number of newly recovered patients  
   - Significant variation in case distribution across provinces  

2. **Recovery and Mortality**:  
   - Overall recovery rate: **84.5%**  
   - Fatality rate: **3.9%**  
   - Clear correlation between population density and case numbers  

3. **Trend Analysis**:  
   - Active cases show an upward trend over time  
   - Recovery rates vary significantly by region

## 4. Managerial Implications

1. **Resource Allocation**:  
   - Focus healthcare resources on high-case provinces  
   - Implement targeted interventions in areas with higher fatality rates  
   - Plan capacity based on regional recovery rates  

2. **Policy Recommendations**:  
   - Develop region-specific containment strategies based on local patterns  
   - Strengthen healthcare infrastructure in areas with higher case-to-recovery ratios  
   - Implement enhanced monitoring in densely populated areas  

3. **Healthcare System Management**:  
   - Maintain adequate medical supplies based on regional case trends  
   - Deploy medical personnel according to provincial needs  
   - Establish emergency response protocols based on regional patterns  

4. **Future Planning**:  
   - Develop early warning systems based on observed patterns  
   - Create contingency plans for areas showing increasing case trends  
   - Implement data-driven decision-making protocols for future health crises
